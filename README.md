# Coding Challenge - React Native

## Introduction

Thanks for taking the time to complete the Nando’s coding challenge!

We hope you find the instructions straight-forward to follow but this is a beta version of the React Native test, so please come back to the team (via whichever recruitment channel you received the test) on any points that need clarification or on any problems you encounter.

Whilst the task is (hopefully) small, we’re looking for a production-quality approach to the project structure and code that you would be happy handing over to another team of developers.

Good luck!!

## Task

Read a list of restaurants from a remote location and display these restaurants in a list view.

## Requirements

- The JSON must be read remotely - no copying down the JSON to a local store!
- Please display the name and address information returned for each restaurant
- Please use the URL property to make the restaurant name open a web view or native browser

## Further Information

Location of restaurant JSON: https://storage.googleapis.com/nandos-engineering-public/coding-challenge-rn/restaurantlist.json

## Submission

We love Github, so a link to a repository on your personal Github account is our preferred method of submission. However, you can also submit via a cloud storage method or zip file sent via email.

Please ensure your submission includes instructions for setting up and running your application.
